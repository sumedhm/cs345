\paragraph{}
This was the first assignment on strings in ESC101 in C at IIT Kanpur. I had not been exposed before to programming, 
and this was the first time I was dealing with strings. It was a simple assignment, I just had to read the string ``Hello'' 
from stdin character by character, and print the string as it is. But it didn't turn out to be as simple as it appears. 
It took me 15 minutes to find the bug in a program of 5 lines before I could submit the assignment. 
\paragraph{}
Let's see how this simple assignment frustrated me. The program which I wrote was as follows:
\paragraph{Program:}
\begin{alltt}
#include <stdio.h>
main()\{
    char string[5];
    int i=0;
    for(i=0;i<5;i++) scanf("\%c", &string[i]);
    printf("\%s", string);
    printf("\textbackslash n");
\}
\end{alltt}

\paragraph{}
Pretty simple to understand and as you can see, I declared the string of 5 characters to save the string, 
then scanned the string from terminal character by character using a for loop. Finally, I print the string contained in the array. 
Should have worked, right? Everything seems correct. I tried executing the program, but it did not work.
\paragraph{}
I entered the input ``Hello'', but the program printed some garbage character after string ``Hello''. 
I tried executing the program again and again carefully so that I do not press any buttons mistakenly after `o'. 
But, surprisingly the output did not change. I tried looking at the program many times, tried to figure out where 
the problem was, but got no clue. After losing all my patience, I went to a friend who had prior experience in programming.
\paragraph{}
He told me an important concept of strings, that you have to terminate them using string termination character - `\textbackslash 0'. 
As soon as I changed my program accordingly, it worked! I just had to change main as follows-
\paragraph{}
\begin{alltt}
        char string[6];
        int i=0;
        for(i=0;i<5;i++) scanf("\%c", &string[i]);
        string[5] = `\textbackslash0';
        printf("\%s", string);
        printf("\textbackslash n");
\end{alltt}

\paragraph{}
And, then this the correct output to the program - ``Hello''.
\paragraph{}
Such minor bugs may go unnoticed in your program and for beginners, waste a lot of time. 
The only thing that helps is lot of practice. So, keep practising and program carefully to avoid such bugs.
